  - **Note** make sure the data set has csv file/s to download.
- Optionally use dataset from another source.
- Load the data you receive into a Pandas `DataFrame`.
- Analyze dataset.
- Verbalize your insights in Markdown cells.
- Visualize your insights in several ways.
  - Have at least two visualizations per data set.
  - Use [Seaborn Example Gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html){:target="_blank"} for inspiration.
- Notebook should have professional polish.
  - In other words, imagine you are presenting it on the job.
