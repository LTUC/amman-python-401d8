# Lab: Exploratory Analysis with Linear Regressions

## Overview

Today you'll perform exploratory analysis by using Linear Regressions on the Kaggle data set of your choice.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

- Select a [Kaggle data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=linear+regression){:target="_blank"} that is suitable for Linear Regression.
  - **Note** make sure the data set is stored as csv file/s.
  - Data set must be **continous** values appropriate for a **Linear** Regression. If you're not sure then ask Instructor or TA.
- Load the data you receive into a Pandas `DataFrame`.
- Show the first five rows of the data set.
- Show the `description` and the `info` of the data set.
- Ensure that any `date` columns have been cast into a `datetime` object in your DataFrame.
- Using a regression model, split your data into train and test portions.
- Fit your training split to the regression model.
- Show your regression model's score.
- Draw at least three conclusions from your regression model.
- Your notebook should be clutter free and polished.

### User Acceptance Tests

No acceptance tests today, but Notebook should clearly display its conclusions.

## Configuration

- Create an account (if you haven't already) at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/){:target="_blank"}.
- Create new Notebook named `Linear Regression`
- Click Share button and select Public access.
- Submit the Public URL for Notebok.

## Strech

- Use a data set from a source other than Kaggle.
- Use a data set not stored as csv, e.g. sqlite.
- Find an existing Linear Regression Notebook on Kaggle and explain it (or add to it.)
